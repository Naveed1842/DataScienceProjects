[Chorus - Rihanna] I'm friends with the monster That's under my bed Get along with the voices inside of my head You're trying to save me Stop holding your breath And you think I'm crazy Yeah, you think I'm crazy (crazy) [Eminem - Verse 1] I wanted the fame, but not the cover of Newsweek Oh well, guess beggers can't be choosey Wanted to receive attention for my music Wanted to be left alone in public excuse me Been wanting my cake, And eat it too And wanting it both ways Fame made me a balloon cause my ego inflated When I blew seep and it was confusing Cause all I wanted to do is be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam Hit the lottery (oh wee) With what I gave up to get was bittersweet It was like winning a huge meet Ironic 'cause I think I'm getting so huge I need a shrink I'm beginning to lose sleep: one sheep, two sheep Going cuckoo and cookey as Kool Keith But I'm actually weirder than you think Cause I'm...

I think you've been wandering off down yonder and stumbled onto Jeff VanVonderen Cause I needed an interventionist to intervene between me and this monster And save me from myself and all this conflict Cause the very thing that I love is killing me and I can't conquer it My OCD is conking me in the head Keep knocking, nobody's home, I'm sleepwalking I'm just relaying what the voice in my head saying Don't shoot the messenger, I'm just friends with the... [Chorus] I'm friends with the monster That's under my bed Get along with the voices inside of my head You're trying to save me Stop holding your breath And you think I'm crazy Yeah, you think I'm crazy Well, that's nothing oh oh oh oh Well, that's nothing oh oh oh oh [Eminem - Verse 3] Call me crazy, but I had this vision One day that, I'd walk amongst you a regular civilian But, until then, drums get killed and I'm Coming straight at Emcees, blood get spilled and I Take it back to the days that, I get on a Dre track Give every kid who got played at Pumped the feeling and shit to say back To the kids who played 'em I ain't here to save the fucking children But if one kid out of a hundred million Who are going through a struggle feels and it relates that's great It's payback, Russell Wilson falling way back In the draft, turn nothing into something still, can make that Straw in the gold chump I will spend Rumpelstiltskin in a hay stack Maybe I need a straightjacket, face facts I am nuts for real, but I'm okay with that It's nothing, I'm still friends with the...

Or was it, cause them bitches wrote him off Little hussy ass fusses, 'cause fuck it, guess it doesn't matter now, does it What difference it make? What it take to get it through your thick skulls As if this ain't some bullshit People don't usually come back this way From a place that was dark as I was in Just to get to this place Now let these words be like a switch blade to a haters rib cage And let it be known from this day forward I wanna just say thanks cause your hate is what gave me the strength So let 'em bic's raise 'cause I came with 5'9â² but I feel like I'm 6'8â³ [Bruno Mars] This one's for you and me, living out our dreams We're all right where we should be With my arms out wide I open my eyes And now all I wanna see Is a sky full of lighters A sky full of lighters [Royce Da 5'9"] By the time you hear this I'll probably already be outtie I advance like going from toting iron to going and buying 4 or 5 of the homies the iron man Audi My daddy told me slow down, boy, you goin' to blow it And I ain't gotta stop the beat a minute To tell Shady I love him the same way that he did Dr Dre on the Chronic Tell him how real he is or how high I am Or how I would kill for him for him to know it I cried plenty tears, my daddy got a bad back So it's only right that I right till he can march right into that post office and tell 'em to hang it up Now his career's Lebron's jersey in 20 years I'll stop when I'm at the very top You shitted on me on your way up It's 'bout to be a scary drop Cause what goes up must come down You going down on something you don't wanna see like a hairy box Every hour, happy hour now Life is wacky now Used to have to eat the cat to get the pussy Now I'm just the cats meoww, ow Classic now, always down for the catch weight like Pacquiao Ya'll are doomed I remember when T-Pain ain't wanna work with me My car starts itself, parks itself and autotunes Cause now I'm in the Aston I went from having my city locked up To getting treated like Kwame Kilpatrick And now I'm fantastic Compared to a weed high And y'all niggas just gossipin' like bitches on a radio and TV See me, we fly Y'all buggin' out like Wendy Williams staring at a bee-hive And how real is that I remember signing my first deal and now I'm the second best I can deal with that Now Bruno can show his ass, without the MTV awards gag

Just stay true to you so Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful oh They can all get fucked. Just stay true to you so I think I'm starting to lose my sense of humor Everything is so tense and gloom I almost feel like I gotta check the temperature in the room Just as soon as I walk in It's like all eyes on me, so I try to avoid any eye contact Cause if I do that then it opens a door to conversation, like I want that I'm not looking for extra attention I just want to be just like you Blend in with the rest of the room Maybe just point me to the closest restroom I don't need no fucking manservant Follow me around, and wiping my ass Laugh at every single joke I crack And half of 'em ain't even funny like Haha Marshall, you're so funny man, you should be a comedian, god damn Unfortunately I am, but I just hide behind the tears of a clown So why don't you all sit down Listen to the tale I'm about to tell Hell, we don't have to trade our shoes And you don't have to walk no thousand miles In my shoes, just to see What it'd be like, to be me I'll be you, let's trade shoes Just to see what I'd be like to Feel your pain, you feel mine Go inside each other's mind Just to see what we find Look at shit through each other's eyes But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful oh They can all get fucked. Just stay true to you so so Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful oh They can all get fucked. Just stay true to you Nobody asked for life to deal us With these bullshit hands we're dealt We gotta take these cards ourselves Flip them, don't expect no help, now I could have either just Sat on my ass and pissed and moaned But take this situation in which I'm placed in And get up and get my own, I was never the type of kid To wait but I know to unpack his bags Never sat on the porch and hoped and prayed For a dad to show up who never did I just wanted to fit in, every single place, every school I went I dreamed of being that cool kid Even if it meant acting stupid, Aunt Edna always told me Keep making that face till it gets stuck like that Meanwhile I'm just standing there Holding my tongue up trying to talk like this Till I stuck my tongue on the frozen stop sign pole at eight years old I learned my lesson and cause I wasn't tryin to impress my friends no more But I already told you my whole life story Not just based on my description Cause where you see it from where you're sitting Is probably a hundred and ten percent different I guess we would have to walk a mile In each other's shoes, at least What size you where? I wear tens Let's see if you can fit your feet In my shoes, just to see What it'd be like, to be me I'll be you, let's trade shoes Just to see what I'd be like to Feel your pain, you feel mine Go inside each other's mind Just to see what we find Look at shit through each other's eyes But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful oh They can all get fucked, just stay true to you so Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful oh They can all get fucked, just stay true to you so Lately I've been hard to reach I've been too long on my own Everybody has a private world Where they can be alone Are you calling me, are you trying to get through Are you reaching out for me, and I'm reaching out for you Yea, to my babies. Stay strong. Daddy will be home soon And to the rest of the world, God gave you the shoes That fit you, so put em on and wear 'em And be yourself man, be proud of who you are Even if it sounds corny, Don't ever let no one tell you, you ain't beautiful

Yeah but he loves you girl and you better know it We're all we got in this world When it spins, when it swirls When it whirls, when it twirls Two little beautiful girls Lookin' puzzled, in a daze I know it's confusing you Daddy's always on the move, mama's always on the news I try to keep you sheltered from it but somehow it seems The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me All the things growing up his daddy that he had to see Daddy don't want you to see but you see just as much as he did We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me But things have gotten so bad between us I don't see us ever being together ever again Like we used to be when we were teenagers But then of course everything always happens for a reason I guess it was never meant to be But it's just something we have no control over and that's what destiny is But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep Maybe one day we'll wake up and this will all just be a dream Now hush little baby, don't you cry Everything's gonna be alright Stiffen that upper lip up little lady, I told ya Daddy's here to hold ya through the night I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why We fear how we feel inside It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby But I promise momma's gon' be alright It's funny I remember back one year when daddy had no money Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up And stuck 'em under the tree and said some of 'em were from me Cause daddy couldn't buy 'em I'll never forget that Christmas I sat up the whole night crying Cause daddy felt like a bum, see daddy had a job But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom And at the time every house that we lived in Either kept getting broken into and robbed Or shot up on the block and your mom was saving money for you in a jar Tryna start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college Almost had a thousand dollars till someone broke in and stole it And I know it hurt so bad it broke your momma's heart And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart Mom and dad was arguin' a lot so momma moved back On the Chalmers in the flat one bedroom apartment And dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara And that's when daddy went to California with his CD and met Dr. Dre And flew you and momma out to see me But daddy had to work, you and momma had to leave me Then you started seeing daddy on the T.V. and momma didn't like it And you and Laney were to young to understand it Papa was a rollin' stone, momma developed a habit And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud Now I'm sitting in this empty house, just reminiscing Lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out To see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now Wow, guess you pretty much are and daddy's still here Laney I'm talkin' to you too, daddy's still here I like the sound of that, yeah It's got a ring to it don't it? Shh, momma's only gone for the moment Now hush little baby, don't you cry Everything's gonna be alright Stiffen that upper lip up little lady, I told ya Daddy's here to hold ya through the night I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why We fear how we feel inside It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby But I promise momma's gon' be alright And if you ask me too Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird I'mma give you the world I'mma buy a diamond ring for you I'mma sing for you I'll do anything for you to see you smile And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine I'mma break that birdies neck I'll go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya And make him eat every carat don't fuck with dad (ha ha)
May I have your attention please? May I have your attention please? Will the real Slim Shady please stand up? I repeat will the real Slim Shady please stand up? We're going to have a problem here Y'all act like you never seen a white person before Jaws all on the floor like Pam and Tommy just burst in the door Started whoopin' her ass worse than before, they first get divorced Throwing her over furniture It's the return of the "Oh wait, no way, your kidding, He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?" And Dr Dre said Nothing you idiots Dr Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement (ha ha) Feminist women love Eminem, chicka chicka chicka Slim Shady I'm sick of him Look at him, walking around grabbing his you know what Flippin' the you know who "yeah, but he's so cute though" Yea I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose But no worse than what's going on in your parent's bedrooms Sometimes I want to get on TV and just let loose, but can't, But it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips And if I'm lucky you might just give it a little kiss And that's the message that we deliver to little kids And expect them not to know what a women's clitoris is.

'Cause sometimes you just feel tired, you feel weak And when you feel weak you feel like you want to just give up But you gotta search within you, you gotta find that inner strength And just pull that shit out of you and get that motivation to not give up And not be a quitter, no matter how bad you want to just fall flat on your face and collapse 'Til I collapse I'm spilling these raps long as you feel 'em 'Til the day that I drop you'll never say that I'm not killing 'em 'Cause when I am not then I'm a stop pinning them And I am not hip-hop and I'm just not Eminem Subliminal thoughts when I'm stop sending them Women are caught in webs spin and hock venom Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illin' to stop Amoxicillin is just not real enough The criminal cop killing hip-hop filling a Minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners You're coming with me, feel it or not You're gonna fear it like I showed you the spirit of god lives in us You hear it a lot, lyrics that shock, is it a miracle Or am I just a product of pop fizzing up For shizzle my whizzle this is the plot listen up You Bizzles forgot Slizzle does not give a fuck 'Til the roof comes off, till the lights go out 'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth. 'Til the smoke clears out and my high perhaps I'm a rip this shit till my bone collapse. 'Til the roof comes off, till the lights go out 'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth. 'Til the smoke clears out and my high perhaps I'm a rip this shit till my bone collapse. Music is like magic there's a certain feeling you get When you're real and you spit and people are feeling your shit This is your moment and every single minute you spittin' Trying to hold onto it 'cause you may never get it again So while you're in it try to get as much shit as you can And when your run is over just admit when it's at its end 'Cause I'm at the end of my wits with half the shit that gets in I got a list, here's the order of my list that it's in; It goes, Reggie, Jay-Z, Tupac and Biggie Andre from Outkast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas and then me But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy So when I'm not put on this list the shit does not offend me That's why you see me walk around like nothing's bothering me Even though half you people got a fuckin' problem with me You hate it but you know respect you've got to give me The press's wet dream like Bobby and Whitney, Nate hit me 'Til the roof comes off, till the lights go out 'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth. 'Til the smoke clears out and my high perhaps I'm a rip this shit till my bone collapse. 'Til the roof comes off, till the lights go out 'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth. 'Til the smoke clears out and my high perhaps I'm a rip this shit till my bone collapse. Soon as a verse starts I eat at an MC's heart What is he thinking? Enough to not go against me, smart And its absurd how people hang on every word I'll probably never get the props I feel I ever deserve But I'll never be served my spot is forever reserved If I ever leave earth that would be the death of me first 'Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothing could ever be worse That's why I'm clever when I put together every verse My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I'm an addict I rap like I'm addicted to smack like I'm Kim Mathers But I don't want to go forth and back in constant battles The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers' So this is like a full blown attack I'm launching at 'em The track is on some battling raps who want some static 'Cause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim matters A plaque of platinum status is whack if I'm not the baddest 'Til the roof comes off, till the lights go out 'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth. 'Til the smoke clears out and my high perhaps I'm a rip this shit till my bone collapse. 'Til the roof comes off, till the lights go out 'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth. 'Til the smoke clears out and my high perhaps I'm a rip this shit till my bone collapse. Until the roof (Until the roof) The roof comes off (The roof comes off) Until my legs (Until my legs) Give out from underneath me (Underneath me, I) I will not fall I will stand tall Feels like no one can beat me
Step by step, heart to heart, left right left We all fall down, Step by step, heart to heart, left right left We all fall down like toy soldiers Bit by bit, torn apart We never win but the battle wages on for toy soldiers I'm suppose to be the soldier, who never blows his composure Even though I hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders I ain't never suppose to show it, my crew ain't suppose to know it Even if it means going toe to toe with the Benzino, it don't matter I never drag 'em in battles that I can handle less I absolutely have to I'm suppose to set an example, I need to be the leader My crew looks for me to guide 'em If some shit ever just pop off I'm suppose to be beside 'em That Ja shit, I tried to squashed it, it was too late to stop it There's a certain line, you just don't cross it, and he crossed it I heard him say Hailie's name on a song and I just lost it It was crazy, this shit went way beyond some Jay Z and Nas shit And even though the battle was won, I feel like we lost it I spent so much energy on it, honestly I'm exhausted I'm so caught it I almost feel like I'm the one who caused it This ain't what I'm in Hip Hop for, it's not why I got in it That was never my object for someone to get killed Why would I want to destroy something I helped build It wasn't my intentions, my intentions were good I went through my whole career with out ever mentioning And that's just outta respect, for not running my mouth And talking about something that I knew nothing about Plus Dre told me stay out, just wasn't my beef, So I did I just fell back, watched and gritted my teeth while he's all over TV Now I'm talking a man who literally saved my life, like fuck it I understand, this is business and this shit just isn't none of my business But still knowing this shit could pop off at any minute cause Step by step, heart to heart, left right left We all fall down, like toy soldiers Bit by bit, torn apart We never win but the battle wages on for toy soldiers It used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme And wouldn't have to worry about one of your people dying But now it's elevated cause once you put someone's kids in it Shit gets escalated, it ain't just words no more, is it It's a different ball game, call names and you ain't just rapping We actually tried to stop the 50 and Ja beef from happening Me and Dre had sat with him, kicked it and had a chat with him And asked him not to start it, he wasn't gonna go after him Until Ja' start yappin' in magazines how he stabbed him Fuck 'em 50, smash him, mash him, and let him have it Meanwhile my intentions pulled me in other directions Some receptionist said the source who answers phones at his desk Has an erection for me and thinks That I'll be his resurrection Tries to blow the dust of his mic and make a new record But now he's fucked the game up cause one of the ways I came up Was through that publication, the same one that made me famous Now the owner of it got a grudge against me for nothing but fuck it That motherfucker can get it too, fuck 'em then But I'm so busy being pissed off, I don't stop to think That we just inherited 50's beef with Murder Inc And he's inherited mine, which is fine, ain't like either of us mind We still have soldiers that's on the front line that's willing to die for us As soon as we give the orders, never to extort us Strictly to show they support us Maybe shout 'em out in a rap or up in a chorus to show we love 'em back And to let 'em know how important it is to have Runyon Avenue soldiers up in our corners Their loyalty to us is worth more then any award is But I ain't trying to have none of my people hurt or murdered It ain't worth it, I can't think of a perfecter way to word it Then to just say that I love y'all too much to see the verdict I'll walk away from it all before I'll let it go any further But don't get it twisted, it's not a plea that I'm coping I'm just willing to be the bigger man If y'all can quit popping off at the jaws with the knocking 'Cause frankly I'm sick of talking I'm not gonna let someone else's coffin rest on my conscience 'cause
Whatever Dre just let it run Ey yo turn the beat up a little bit Ey yo this song is for anyone Fuck it just shut up and listen Ey yo I sit back, with this pack, of zigzags And this bag, of this weed It gives me, the shit needed to be, the most meanest MC on this On this earth 'cause since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works And it sells and it helps in its self to relieve All this tension dispensing me, sentence is getting it The stress has been eating me, recently Off of this chest and I rest to get peacefully But at least have the decency in you to leave me alone When you freaks see me out in the streets When I'm eating or feeding my daughter to not come and speak to me I don't know you and no I don't owe you a motherfuckin' thing I'm not Mr.'N Sync and I'm not what your friends think I'm not Mr.Friendly, I can be a prick, if you tempt me my tank is on empty No patience is in me and if you offend me I'm lifting you ten feet In the air, I don't care who was there and who saw me just jaw you Go call you a lawyer File you a lawsuit, I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe I'm tired of all you I don't mean to be mean but it's all I can be, it's just me And I am, whatever you say I am If I wasn't, then why would I say I am? In the papers, the news, everyday I am Radio won't even play my jam 'Cause I am, whatever you say I am If I wasn't, then why would I say I am? In the papers, the news, everyday I am I don't know it's just the way I am Sometimes I just feel like my father, I hate to be bothered With all of this nonsense it's constant, and "oh it's his lyrical content!" The song "Guilty Conscience" has gotten such rotten responses And all of this controversy circles me and it seems Like the media immediately points a finger at me So I point one back at 'em, but not the index or the pinky Or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up when you don't give a fuck When you won't just put up with the bullshit they pull 'Cause they full of shit too When a dude's gettin' bullied and shoots up his school And they blame it on Marilyn And the heroin, where were the parents at? And look at where it's at Middle America, now it's a tragedy, now it's so sad to see An upper class city having this happening Then attack Eminem 'cause I rap this way But I'm glad 'cause they feed me the fuel That I need for the fire to burn and it's burnin' and I have returned And I am, whatever you say I am If I wasn't, then why would I say I am? In the papers, the news, everyday I am Radio won't even play my jam 'Cause I am, whatever you say I am If I wasn't, then why would I say I am? In the papers, the news, everyday I am I don't know it's just the way I am I'm so sick and tired of being admired That I wish that I would just die or get fired And drop from my label and stop with the fables I'm not gonna be able to top on "My name is" And pigeon holdin' to some poppy sensations They cop me rotation at rock 'n' roll stations And I just do not got the patience To deal with these cocky Caucasians Who think I'm some wigga who just tries to be black 'Cause I talk with an accent and grab on my balls So they always keep asking the same fucking questions What school did I go to, what hood I grew up in, the why, the who, what When and where and the how, 'til I'm grabbing my hair and I'm tearing it out You've been driving me crazy I can't take it, I'm racing, I'm pacing, I stand and I sit And I'm thankful for every fan that I get, but I can't take a shit In the bathroom without someone standing by it No I won't sign your autograph, you can call me an asshole, I'm glad 'Cause I am, whatever you say I am If I wasn't, then why would I say I am? In the papers, the news, everyday I am Radio won't even play my jam 'Cause I am, whatever you say I am If I wasn't, then why would I say I am? In the papers, the news, everyday I am I don't know it's just the way I am

Feels like a close, it's coming to Fuck am I gonna do? It's too late to start over This is the only thing I, thing I know Sometimes I feel like all I ever do is Find different ways to word the same, old song Ever since I came along From the day the song called ''Hi! My Name Is'' dropped Started thinking my name was fault 'Cause anytime things went wrong I was the one who they would blame it on The media made me the equivalent of a modern-day Genghis Khan Tried to argue it was only entertainment, dawg Gangsta? Naw, courageous balls Had to change my style, they said I'm way too soft And I sound like AZ and Nas, out came the claws And the fangs been out since then But up until the instant that I've been against it It was ingrained in me that I wouldn't amount to a shitstain I thought No wonder I had to unlearn everything my brain was taught Do I really belong in this game? I pondered I just wanna play my part, should I make waves or not? So back and forth in my brain the tug of war wages on And I don't wanna seem ungrateful or disrespect the artform I was raised upon But sometimes you gotta take a loss And have people rub it in your face before you get made pissed off And keep pluggin', it's your only outlet And your only outfit so you know they gonna talk about it Better find a way to counter it quick and make it, ah Feel like I've already said this a kabillion eighty times How many times can I say the same thing different ways that rhyme? What I really wanna say is, is there anyone else that can relate to my story? Bet you feel the same way I felt when I was in the same place you are I was afraid to Make a single sound Afraid I will never find a way out, out, out Afraid I never before I didn't wanna go another round An angry man's power will shut you up Trip wires fill this house with tip-toe love Run out of excuses with every word So here I am and I will not run Guts over fear, (The time is here) Guts over fear, (I shall not tear) For all the times I let you push me around And let you keep me down (Now I got) Guts over fear, guts over fear Feels like a close, it's coming to Fuck am I gonna do? It's too late to start over This is the only thing I, thing I know I know what it was like, I was there once, single parents Hate your appearance, did you struggle to find your place in this world? And the pain spawns all the anger on But it wasn't until I put the pain in songs learned who to aim it on That I made a spark, started to spit hard as shit Learned how to harness it while the reins were off And there was a lot of bizarre shit, but the crazy part Was soon as I stopped saying "I gave a fuck" Haters started to appreciate my art And it just breaks my heart to look at all the pain I've caused But what am I gonna do when the rage is gone? And the lights go out in the trailer park? And the window that was closing and there's nowhere else I can go with flows in And I'm frozen cause there's no more emotion for me to pull from Just a bunch of playful songs that I made for fun So to the break of dawn here I go recycling the same, old song But I'd rather make "Not Afraid 2" than making another mothafuckin' "We Made You" uh Now I don't wanna seem indulgent when I discuss my lows and my highs My demise and my uprise, pray to God I just opened enough eyes later on Gave you the supplies and the tools to hopefully use it to make you strong And enough to lift yourself up when you feel like I felt 'Cause I can't explain to y'all how dang exhausted my legs felt Just having to balance my damn self But on eggshells I was made to walk But thank you, ma, 'cause that gave me the Strength to cause Shady-mania, so many empty that stadium At least I made it out of that house and a found a place in this world when the day was done So this is for every kid who all's they ever did was dreamt that one day just getting accepted I represent him or her, anyone similar, you are the reason that I made this song Everything you're scared to say don't be afraid to say no more From this day on forward, just let them a-holes talk Take it with a grain of salt and eat their fucking faces off The legend of the angry blonde lives on through you when I'm gone And to think I was gone I was afraid to Make a single sound Afraid I will never find a way out, out, out Afraid I never before I didn't wanna go another round An angry man's power will shut you up Trip wires fill this house with tip-toe love Run out of excuses with every word So here I am and I will not run Guts over fear, (The time is here) Guts over fear, (I shall not tear) For all the times I let you push me around And let you keep me down (Now I got) Guts over fear, guts over fear

On second thought I just fucking wished he would die I look at Hailie, and I couldn't picture leaving her side Even if I hated Kim, I grit my teeth and I'd try To make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake I maybe made some mistakes, but I'm only human but I'm man enough to face them today What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets outta that gun 'Cause I'da killed him, shit I would've shot Kim and him both It's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to "The Eminem Show" I'm sorry momma! I never meant to hurt you! I never meant to make you cry, but tonight I'm cleaning out my closet (one more time) I said I'm sorry momma! I never meant to hurt you! I never meant to make you cry, but tonight I'm cleaning out my closet Now I would never diss my own momma just to get recognition Take a second to listen for who you think this record is dissing But put yourself in my position, just try to envision Witnessing your momma popping prescription pills in the kitchen Bitching that someone's always going through her purse and shit's missing Going through public housing systems, victim of Munchhausen's Syndrome My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't 'Til I grew up, now I blew up, it makes you sick to ya stomach Doesn't it? Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me Ma? So you could try to justify the way you treated me Ma? But guess what? You're getting older now and it's cold when you're lonely And Nathan's growing up so quick he's gonna know that you're phony And Hailie's getting so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful But you'll never see her, she won't even be at your funeral! See what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong Bitch do your song, keep telling yourself that you was a mom! But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get You selfish bitch, I hope you fucking burn in hell for this shit Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me?

Pharmaceuticals are the bomb, mom. Beautiful! She killed the fuckin' dog with the medicine she done fed it Feed it a fuckin' aspirin and say that it has a headache "Here, want a snack, you hungry, you fuckin' brat? Look at that, it's a Xanax, take it and take a nap Eat it," "But I don't need it," "Well, fuck it then break it up Take a little piece and beat it before you wake Nathan up" "All right, Ma, you win, I don't feel like arguin' I'll do it, pop and gobble it and start wobblin'" Stumble, hobble, tumble, slip, drip then I fall in bed With a bottle of meds and a Heath Ledger bobblehead My mom loved Valium and lots of drugs That's why I am like I am 'cause I'm like her Because my mom loved Valium and lots of drugs That's why I'm on what I'm on 'cause I'm my mom My mom, I'm just like her My mom, my mom, my mom My mom, my mom, my mom My mom, my mom, my mom My mom, my momma Sorry Mom, I still love you though Dr. Dre, 2010, hey, this shit is hella hard, homie Yo, take us on outta here
Mom I know I let you down And though you say the days are happy Why is the power off, and I'm fucked up? And mom, I know he's not around But don't you place the blame on me As you pour yourself another drink and I guess we are who we are Headlights shining in the dark night, I drive on Maybe we took this too far I went in headfirst Never thinking about who what I said hurt, in what verse My mom probably got it the worst The brunt of it, but as stubborn as we are Did I take it too far? Cleaning out my closet and all them other songs But regardless I don't hate you 'cause ma! You're still beautiful to me, cause you're my mom Though far be it for you to be calling, my house was Vietnam Desert Storm and both of us put together Can form an atomic bomb equivalent to chemical warfare And forever we can drag this on and on But, agree to disagree That gift from me up under the Christmas tree don't mean shit to me You're kicking me out? It's fifteen degrees and it's Christmas Eve (little prick just leave) Ma, let me grab my fucking coat, anything to have each other's goats Why we always at each others throats? Especially when dad, he fucked us both We're in the same fucking boat, you'd think that it'd make us close (nope) Further away that drove us, but together headlights shine, a car full of belongings Still got a ways to go, back to grandma's house it's straight up the road And I was the man of the house, the oldest, so my shoulders carried the weight of the load Then Nate got taken away by the state at eight years old, and That's when I realized you were sick and it wasn't fixable or changeable And to this day we remained estranged and I hate it though, but I guess we are who we are Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on Maybe we took this too far 'Cause to this day we remain estranged and I hate it though 'Cause you ain't even get to witness your grand baby's growth But I'm sorry mama for 'Cleaning Out My Closet', at the time I was angry Rightfully maybe so, never meant that far to take it though, 'cause Now I know it's not your fault, and I'm not making jokes That song I no longer play at shows and I cringe every time it's on the radio And I think of Nathan being placed in a home And all the medicine you fed us And how I just wanted you to taste your own, but Now the medications taken over and your mental states deteriorating slow And I'm way too old to cry, that shit's painful though But ma, I forgive you, so does Nathan yo All you did, all you said, you did your best to raise us both Foster care, that cross you bare, few may be as heavy as yours But I love you Debbie Mathers, oh what a tangled web we have, 'cause One thing I never asked was where the fuck my deadbeat dad was Fuck it I guess he had trouble keeping up with every address But I'd have flipped every mattress, every rock and desert cactus Own a collection of maps and followed my kids to the edge of the atlas Someone ever moved them from me? That you could bet your ass's If I had to come down the chimney dressed as Santa, kidnap them And although one has met their grandma Once you pulled up in our drive one night as we were leaving to get some hamburgers Me, her and Nate, we introduced you, hugged you And as you left I had this overwhelming sadness come over me As we pulled off to go our separate paths, and I saw your headlights as I looked back And I'm mad I didn't get the chance to thank you for being my Mom and my Dad So Mom, please accept this as a tribute I wrote this on the jet I guess I had to get this off my chest, I hope I get the chance to lay it before I'm dead The stewardess said to fasten my seat belt, I guess we're crashing So if I'm not dreaming, I hope you get this message that I'll always love you from afar 'Cause you're my mama I guess we are who we are Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on Maybe we took this too far I want a new life One without a cause So I'm coming home tonight Well no matter what the cost And if the plane goes down Or if the crew can't wake me up Just know that I was alright And I was not afraid to die Oh even if there's songs to sing My children will carry me Just know that I'm alright I was not afraid to die Because I put my faith in my new girl So I never say goodbye cruel world Just know that I'm alright I am not afraid to die I guess we are who we are Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on Maybe we took this too far, I want a new life

Here to stay Even when I'm gone When I close my eyes Through the passage of time Kings never die I can hear the drummer drumming And the trumpets, someone's tryna summon someone, I know something's coming But I'm running from it to be standing at the summit And plummet, how come it wasn't what I thought it was, was it Too good to be true? Have nothing, get it all but too much of it then lose it again Did I swallow hallucinogens, 'cause if not, where the hell did it go? 'Cause here I sit in Lucifer's den by the dutch oven just choosing to sin Even if it means I'm selling my soul, just to be the undisputed again Do whatever I gotta do just to win 'Cause I got this motherfucking cloud over my head Crown around it, thorns on it Cracks in it, bet you morons didn't Think I'd be back, did ya? How 'bout that I'm somehow now back to the underdog But no matter how loud that I bark, this sport is something I never bow-wow'd at I complain about the game, I shout and I pout, it's a love-hate But I found out that I can move a mountain of doubt Even when you bitches are counting me out, and I appear to be down for the count Only time I ever been out and about is Driving around town with my fucking whereabouts in a doubt 'Cause I been lost tryna think of what I did to get here but I'm not a quitter Gotta get up, give it all I got or give up Spit on, shit on, stepped on, but kept going I'm tryna be headstrong But it feels like I slept on my neck wrong 'Cause you're moving onto the next, but is the respect gone?

You sit there stone-faced, as if I'm not here Can't you see that I've been crying? I didn't know you'd be insane Dreams can be so deceiving You're an itch I can't reach, a wound that won't heal The smell of skin that's burning I didn't know you'd be insane But it's true, and just say all I am to you is a Pain in my neck, thorn in my side Stain on my blade, blood on my knife Been dreaming of her, all of my life But she won't come true, she's just my nightmare I woke up to She's twisted, he's a rebel, she's sick, he's hard to handle The worst part of all is he just don't care She's twisted like a rope, that is wrapped around his throat But the worst part of all is she really don't give a (shit) (She don't give a shit) Sometimes I wish that you'd just die 'Cause I'm too afraid of leaving I didn't know you'd be insane Dreams can be so deceiving (How did it come to this? Why do I fantasize to kill you when you're sleeping?) I didn't know you feel the same When I say you're no good, all you are to me, is a Pain in my neck, thorn in my side Stain on my blade, blood on my knife Been dreaming of her, all of my life But she won't come true, she's just my nightmare I woke up to She's twisted, he's a rebel, she's sick, he's hard to handle The worst part of all is he just don't care She's twisted like a rope, that is wrapped around his throat But the worst part of all is she really don't give a Love ain't no fairytale, love is a buried nail Inside of this heart of stone, so you wanna get married? Well Romeo, Romeo, smokin' blow with Antonio In the back alley takin' shots of whiskey and only gold Juliet's at the nudie bar, doin' God only knows Neither one of 'em came to see the dog and the pony show But a bitch is a bitch, and a horse is a horse, ain't it? Sorry, I can't afford to get your daddy's old Porsche painted Sorry, Juliet that you embedded the sayin' If a dollar makes you holler, well then I'm gettin' the short change of it Feel like I've been asleepin' alone and lovin' this angel Entangled between a dream and a coma Walkin' the edge of this cliff, like a sheep to it's owner Then wake up to this fuckin' bitch with an evil persona Now if you say that you hate somebody and you livin' with them Then they pack up and leave and then you bitch about how you miss 'em You gotta see the pattern of the blood all over the steerin' wheel Love is a cannibal ridin' a carnival carousel 'Round and 'round we roll, where it stops, baby nobody knows Some people go crazy and they lose control Some people jump off, some people won't let go Some people say love, some people say why Some people don't love, they just want a free ride The rain won't stop, it'll never dry If she's in the house of pain then love is standin' outside She's twisted, he's a rebel, she's sick, he's hard to handle The worst part of all is he just don't care She's twisted like a rope, that is wrapped around his throat But the worst part of all is she really don't give a (shit) (She don't give a shit) But maybe I'm the twisted one that screwed this up So I guess this means goodbye, for now
Yo, I can't sing but I feel like singing I wanna fuckin' sing 'Cuz I'm happy, yeah, I'm happy I got my baby back, yo, check it out Somedays I sit staring out the window Watchin' this world pass me by Sometimes I think there's nothin' to live for I almost break down and cry Sometimes I think I'm crazy, I'm crazy, oh, so crazy Why am I here? Am I just wasting my time? But then I see my baby, suddenly I'm not crazy It all makes sense when I look into her eyes, oh, no 'Cuz sometimes it feels like the world's on my shoulders Everyone's leaning on me 'Cuz sometimes it feels like the world's almost over But then she comes back to me My baby girl keeps getting' older I watch her grow up with pride People make jokes 'cuz they don't understand me They just don't see my real side I act like shit, don't phase me, inside it drives me crazy My insecurities could eat me alive But then I see my baby, suddenly I'm not crazy It all makes sense when I look into her eyes, oh, no 'Cuz sometimes it feels like the world's on my shoulders Everyone's leaning on me 'Cuz sometimes it feels like the world's almost over But then she comes back to me Man, if I could sing, I'd keep singin' this song to my daughter If I could hit the notes, I'd blow something as long as my father To show her how I feel about her, how proud I am that I got her God, I'm a daddy, I'm so glad that her mom didn't Now you probably get this picture from my public persona That Imma pistol packin' drug addict, who bags on his mama But I wanna to just take this time out to be perfectly honest 'Cuz there's a lot of shit I keep bottled, that hurts deep inside Of my soul and just know that I grow colder the older I grow This boulder on my shoulder gets heavy and harder to hold And this load is like the weight of the world And I think my neck is breakin' Should I just give up or try to live up to these expectations? Now look, I love my daughter more than life in itself But I got a wife that's determined to make my life livin' hell But I handle it well, given the circumstances I'm dealt So many chances, man, it's too bad, could have had someone else But the years that I've wasted is nothing to the tears that I've tasted So here's what I'm facin', 3 felonies, 6 years of probation I've went to jail for this woman, I've been to bat for this woman I've taken bats to people's backs, bent over backwards for this woman Man, I should have seen it coming, what I stick my penis up in? Wouldn't have ripped the pre-nup up if I'da seen what she was fuckin'? But fuck it, it is over, there's no more reason to cry no more I got my baby, baby, the only lady that I adore, Hailie So sayonara, try tommorra, nice to know ya Our baby's traveled back to the arms of her rightful owner And suddenly it seems like my shoulder blades have just shifted It's like the greatest gift you can get, the weight has been lifted And now it don't feel like the world's on my shoulders Everyone's leaning on me 'Cuz my baby knows that her dad is a soldier Nothing can take her from me Told you I can't sing Oh, well, I tried Hailie, remember when I said If you ever need anything Daddy would be right there? Guess what? Daddy's here And I ain't going nowhere Baby, I love you

Snap back to reality, Oh there goes gravity, Oh there goes rabbit he choked He's so mad, but he won't give up that easy No, He won't have it, he knows his whole backs of these ropes It don't matter, he's dope He knows that, but he's broke He's so stacked that he knows When he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's Back to the lab again Yo This whole rhapsody He better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him [Chorus] You better lose yourself in the music, the moment You own it, you better never let it go You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow This opportunity comes once in a lifetime Yo You better lose yourself in the music, the moment You own it, you better never let it go You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow This opportunity comes once in a lifetime Yo [Verse 2] His soul's escaping, through this hole that itÃ¢ÂÂs gaping This world is mine for the taking Make me king, as we move toward a, new world order A normal life is boring, but superstardom's close to post mortar It only grows harder, only grows hotter He blows us all over these hoes is all on him Coast to coast shows, he's know as the globetrotter Lonely roads, God only knows He's grown farther from home, he's no father He goes home and barely knows his own daughter But hold your nose cuz here goes the cold water His hoes don't want him no mo, he's cold product They moved on to the next schmoe who flows He nose dove and sold nada So the soap opera is told and unfolds I suppose it's old potna, but the beat goes on Da da dum da dum da da [Chorus] You better lose yourself in the music, the moment You own it, you better never let it go You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow This opportunity comes once in a lifetime Yo You better lose yourself in the music, the moment You own it, you better never let it go You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow This opportunity comes once in a lifetime Yo [Verse 3] No more games, I'm gun' change what you call rage Tear this mothafuckin roof off like 2 dogs caged I was playin in the beginnin, the mood all changed I been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage But I kept rhymin and stepwritin the next cypher Best believe somebody's payin the pied piper All the pain inside amplified by the fact That I can't get by with my 9 to 5 And I can't provide the right type of life for my family Cuz man, these goddam food stamps don't buy diapers And it's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life And these times are so hard and it's getting even harder Tryin to feed and water my seed, plus See dishonor caught up bein a father and a prima donna Baby mama drama's screamin on and Too much for me to wanna Stay in one spot, another jam or not Has gotten me to the point, I'm like a snail I've got to formulate a plot fore I end up in jail or shot Success is my only mothafuckin option, failure's not Mom, I love you, but this trail has got to go I cannot grow old in Salem's lot So here I go is my shot. Feet fail me not cuz maybe the only opportunity that I got [Chorus] You better lose yourself in the music, the moment You own it, you better never let it go You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow This opportunity comes once in a lifetime Yo You better lose yourself in the music, the moment You own it, you better never let it go You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow This opportunity comes once in a lifetime Yo [Outro] You can do anything you set your mind to, man [Outro]
